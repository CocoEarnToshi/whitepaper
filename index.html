    <h1>🐱 COCO ($COCO) — The Base Memecoin That Pays $TOSHI Every 5 Minutes</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the world of COCO ($COCO) — a fully community-driven memecoin on the Base blockchain, designed to reward holders automatically in $TOSHI, the iconic cat coin of Base.</p>
    <p>COCO isn’t just a meme — it’s a revolution in how we reward community participation. Every 5 minutes, holders get paid in $TOSHI — automatically.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Is TOSHI?</h2>
    <p><strong>TOSHI on CoinMarketCap:</strong> <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toshithecat/" target="_blank">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toshithecat/</a></p>
    <p>TOSHI is one of the biggest and fastest-growing memecoins on the Base Blockchain. It’s named after Toshi the cat — and it represents the heart of the Base memecoin movement.</p>
    <p>We chose $TOSHI as the reward token to support our fellow feline friend and spread awareness about the Base ecosystem.</p>
    <p>While Solana and other chains are flooded with rug pulls and bots due to one-click token creators, Base offers a fresh start. And we're proud to be building a fun, fair, and safe memecoin environment here.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why COCO?</h2>
    <p>COCO rewards holders with $TOSHI — automatically.
    It’s a coin made by the people, for the people — with no centralized control, no unfair advantage, and no dev wallet.</p>
    <p>Here’s what makes COCO special:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔁 Auto-paid $TOSHI rewards every 5 minutes</li>
      <li>📏 100% Community-owned</li>
      <li>🔥 Liquidity burned forever</li>
      <li>✅ 1% trade tax — goes directly to the $TOSHI rewards pool</li>
      <li>🧠 Smart contract handles payouts (no team involved)</li>
      <li>🐾 The more $COCO you hold, the more $TOSHI you earn</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How Does the 1% Tax Work?</h2>
    <p>Every time someone buys or sells $COCO, a 1% tax is collected.
    This tax is not sent to a dev wallet, but instead to a smart contract.</p>
    <p>⏱️ Every 5 minutes, that contract automatically pays out all collected $TOSHI to $COCO holders — based on how much COCO you hold. The more COCO, the larger your share.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
